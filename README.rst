Vasa
====

Vasa is an experimental Continuous Integration/Continous Deployment server.

**This project is currently in a very early stage and probably not useful in
any way. Documentation will follow as the project evolves.**


Features/goals:
---------------

- Distributed builds - it should be easy to just throw in more machines to improve
  build performance

- Good looking - the web UI should be attractive and easy to use without
  customizations

- Configuration in Python - handle complex CI setups without complex
  configuration files. Use to the power of Python to manage the complexity

- Responsive - There should be no delays between pushing to SCM, getting the
  build started and distributed to slaves. The web UI should reflect this
  immidiately without delays and page reloads

- Dynamic branching - handle pull requests or newly branches without
  the need to reconfigure the CI server.
